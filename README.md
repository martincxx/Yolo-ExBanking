### Running on Docker

**Important:** You need to have Docker installed and configured. If necessary refer to the [Docker Documentation](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) for your prefered platform.

This project contains a two `Dockerfile`(s) The first one will be used if you feel like running the Functional Test Suite on Docker.

First, build the `yolobanking` image.

```bash
docker build -f Dockerfile -t yoloexbanking:latest .
```

And now you can run Functional tests on a Docker container.

```bash
docker run -i -v $(pwd):/app -t yoloexbanking:latest npm run artillery:test
```

Note that there is a second `Dockerfile` (Dockerfile.load) that will be used to test the non-functional tests.
Now, build the `Artillery` image.

```bash
docker build -f Dockerfile.load -t load-exbanking:latest .
```

And now you can run Functional tests on a Docker container.

```bash
docker run --platform linux/amd64 -i -v $(pwd):/app -t load-exbanking:latest

```
